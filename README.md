# INTELSCHOOLBUS-THE-SYSTEM-FOR-COUNTING-AND-CONTROLLING-STUDENTS-ON-SCHOOL-BUSES

## Information
This repository contains my graduation project, developed by `Le Nhat Tan` in 2024 as part of the requirements for his Bachelor of Engineering degree in `Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering at Ton Duc Thang University` (Intake K24, academic year 2020-2024). The project was supervised by `Dr. Le Anh Vu`. 

Real-time passenger counting on buses is a crucial task for enhancing monitoring efficiency in transportation, education, and smart city development, aligning with the trends and goals of digital transformation. This project introduces a compact system featuring an AI-powered camera integrated with a GPS module to monitor and count passengers or students in real time on buses, addressing safety and operational concerns in public transportation.

## Introduction

## Abstract

Compared to existing research utilizing various methods such as DeepSORT, Kalman Filters, and YOLO variants with hardware like Raspberry Pi and Arduino, this work advances the field by leveraging next-generation hardware based on RISC-V architecture. It incorporates a powerful integrated NPU with an optimized model for embedded systems, combined with essential components to ensure effective and stable operation in real-world conditions.

Specifically, the system employs a YOLO model converted to a lighter format (cvimodel), utilizing a head detection model trained on 10,000 images in conjunction with ByteTrack tracking. The report also highlights limitations of existing solutions and the optimized features of the proposed system.
The system has been ordered and deployed on buses within The Hong Ngoc â€“ Ruby School Education System (part of the Tri Duc Education System). The results of this project were accepted at The 13th International Conference on Green and Human Information Technology (ICGHIT) is co-hosted by Green and Human Information Technology (GHIT), The Institute of Electronics and Information Engineers (IEIE). Additionally, this project advanced to the Competition Round of the "AI. STAR 2024" contest for innovative AI application projects in Ho Chi Minh City, organized by the Department of Science and Technology of Ho Chi Minh City, with SIHUB serving as the implementing unit.
