# INTELSCHOOLBUS-THE-SYSTEM-FOR-COUNTING-AND-CONTROLLING-STUDENTS-ON-SCHOOL-BUSES

## Information
This repository contains my graduation project, developed by `Le Nhat Tan` in 2024 as part of the requirements for his Bachelor of Engineering degree in `Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering at Ton Duc Thang University HCMC, Vietnam` (Intake K24, academic year 2020-2024). The project was advised by `Dr. Le Anh Vu`. 

## Introduction

## Abstract
Real-time passenger counting on buses is a crucial task for enhancing monitoring efficiency in transportation, education, and smart city development, aligning with the trends and goals of digital transformation. This project introduces a compact system featuring an AI-powered camera integrated with a GPS module to monitor and count passengers or students in real time on buses, addressing safety and operational concerns in public transportation.

Compared to existing research utilizing various methods such as DeepSORT, Kalman Filters, and YOLO variants with hardware like Raspberry Pi and Arduino, this work advances the field by leveraging next-generation hardware based on RISC-V architecture. It incorporates a powerful integrated NPU with an optimized model for embedded systems, combined with essential components to ensure effective and stable operation in real-world conditions.

Specifically, the system employs a YOLO model converted to a lighter format (cvimodel), utilizing a head detection model trained on 10,000 images in conjunction with ByteTrack tracking. The report also highlights limitations of existing solutions and the optimized features of the proposed system.
The system has been ordered and deployed on buses within The Hong Ngoc â€“ Ruby School Education System (part of the Tri Duc Education System). The results of this project were accepted at The 13th International Conference on Green and Human Information Technology (ICGHIT) is co-hosted by Green and Human Information Technology (GHIT), The Institute of Electronics and Information Engineers (IEIE). Additionally, this project advanced to the Competition Round of the "AI. STAR 2024" contest for innovative AI application projects in Ho Chi Minh City, organized by the Department of Science and Technology of Ho Chi Minh City, with SIHUB serving as the implementing unit.

## Acknowledgment
First and foremost, I would like to extend my deepest gratitude to my undergraduate thesis advisor, Dr. Le Anh Vu. Throughout the process of completing my thesis, I encountered many questions and uncertainties, all of which were met with his patient and enthusiastic guidance. He not only clarified my doubts but also imparted valuable knowledge related to my research topic. I am sincerely thankful for the time and effort he dedicated to helping me understand complex concepts. His passionate mentorship and clear direction played a crucial role in enabling me to successfully complete this significant and meaningful thesis. It is a deeply humane and purposeful project, one I have always aspired to undertake, and I feel incredibly fortunate that he helped me seize this opportunity.  

I would also like to express my appreciation to all the faculty members of the Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering. The foundational knowledge they imparted has equipped me with the understanding needed to pursue advanced research and undertake meaningful projects like this one.  Additionally, I am grateful to Mr. Nghia and Mr. Dung, senior peers who generously supported me throughout the process. My special thanks also go to Mr. Tien, Vice Principal of Ruby Hong Ngoc Primary and Secondary School, for providing the necessary support and permissions that allowed me to deploy my system on the school bus. During the system testing phase, Mr. Tri, the school bus driver, offered invaluable assistance with great enthusiasm and I am sincerely thankful for his kindness and cooperation.

Every form of assistance I received from Dr. Le Anh Vu, the faculty members, and my peers is something I will always cherish and hold dear. Once again, I sincerely thank Dr. Le Anh Vu for accepting me as his student and guiding me through my undergraduate thesis with such dedication and care.
